# Jail2Ban
Fail2ban version for windows in vb.net - inspired on wail2ban - json based -> jail :)

- Log every failed attempt (windows log does not retain a lot of data by default setting)
- Create a webservice (maybe REST) to share between different server an IP reputation
- Add into the webservice project a web page showing IP reputation and logs
- Publish webservice for the community (source code of webservice will be shared in this repo)
